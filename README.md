# dnd5e-journal

A player's journal for DnD 5e characters meant for binding into a book.

## How to Use

TODO: Write properly

- Turn into PDF using Typst
- Throw into BookbinderJS to turn into signatures for binding
- Print on A4 paper using appropriate settings (mirroring along short side, IIRC)
- Bind into book using a method of your choosing

## Why?

I've been low-key interested in bookbinding for quite some time, but never had any actual *reason* to bind myself a book. The simplest projects for beginners you see are often notebooks, something I don't use, and binding a bunch of notebooks only to then throw them out seemed unnecessarily wasteful.

Recently, however, we finally started up a new tabletop campaign at home and by chance, I stumbled upon the rather fantastic [DnD 5e Player Journal by Glassstaff](https://www.glassstaff.com/products/dnd-5e-player-journal), which I can recommend as a great product wholeheartedly.

Anyway, this gave me the inspiration for an actual project that I can turn into a book and I set out to make my own version of a player's journal.
